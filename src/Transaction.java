/**
 * Essentially, a movement of funds of funds between any two account entities, whether that is between the user and the
 * bank, or the bank and the portfolio. Every {@link User} must first request a transaction, before the funds are
 * reallocated. An admin {@link User} is able to resolve the transaction such that the funds or asset associated with
 * the transaction is either approved or denied. Also, an admin {@link User} who requests a transaction is able to
 * resolve the transaction immediately. In either case, to request or to resolve, the {@link User} is asked to confirm
 * the decision to help minimize accidental {@link User} action, particularly when resolving a transaction.
 * <p>When a transaction is first requested, the request {@link User}, the amount, the date and time requested,
 * the type of transaction, the status of the transaction, and the transaction ID are set. By default, the status
 * of a requested transaction is set to <code>OPEN</code>. If the {@link User} requesting the transaction is a
 * non-admin, the request is added to the list of requests ({@link Account}) to be resolved.</p>
 * <p>When a transaction is resolved by an admin {@link User} the {@link #resolveUser}, {@link #resolveDate}, and the
 * {@link #transactionStatus} are updated. If the status is set to <code>DENIED</code>, the request is removed from the
 * list of transaction requests (if requested by a non-admin {@link User}) and added to the transaction history
 * ({@link Account}) without any funds being reallocated. If transaction is neither <code>DENIED</code> nor
 * <code>CANCELLED</code> (set when either the request or resolution is being made, the funds or {@link Asset}
 * associated with transaction are processed, and the appropriate {@link Balance}(s) are updated.</p>
