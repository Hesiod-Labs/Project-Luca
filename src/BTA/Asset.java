     *     time. </li>
     *     <li>Stop Limit (option): a stop limit order to buy automatically becomes a limit order when the bid price is
     *     at or above the stop price, or the option trades at or above the stop price. A stop limit order to sell
     *     automatically becomes a limit order when the ask price is at or below the stop price, or when the option
     *     trades at or below the stop price. The option stop election is based on the exchange's best bid or off (BBO)
